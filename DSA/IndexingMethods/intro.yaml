Linear Indexing:
    A linear index is an index file organized as a sequence of key-value pairs where the keys 
    are in sorted order and the pointers either (1) point to the position of the complete record 
    on disk, (2) point to the position of the primary key in the primary index, or (3) are actually 
    the value of the primary key.

Tree-Based Indexing:
    Tree-based indexing involves using data structures that follow a tree-like model, with parent 
    nodes, child nodes, and leaf nodes in a hierarchical order. Two popular tree-based indexing 
    methods are B-tree and B+ tree
