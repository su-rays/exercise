Data Structure:
    Binary Trees - has exactly two children of each nodes
    Binary Search Trees - each nodes left child has less value then right clild
    AVL Trees - diff b/w the heights of left and right subtrees for every node are less than or equal to 1
    B-Trees (Balanced Trees) - maintain balance by splitting and merging nodes during insertions and deletions


Algorithm:
    Searching:
        Breadth First Search
        Depth First Search
    Traversal:
        Pre-Order Traversal
        In-Order Traversal
        Post-Order Traversal
